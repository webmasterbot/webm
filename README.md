#### webmaster v2 coming soon! hopefully.
## welcome to the future of webmaster!
Yeah, it's in development, after literally two years. Good news though: I managed to get the github repo on my phone so I could work on it without a computer... oopsie how did that happen? So Webmaster is going back into development.  
And hopefully this time it'll be useful ;)  
with <3, beackers

## webmaster's future looks like:
* some real automod going on
* what was that pesky &? shoot let's get some slash commands in here!!
* those cool as heck things called buttons
* actually useful features for certain servers
* I'm sure I'll think of some more. good thing I can update this whenever now :D

please! if you wanna tell me something you want in my bot PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know! open an issue! @mention me a bajillion times! I GOTTA KNOW! because webmaster is one of these things that's being talked about here:
